            Mental health is a vital component of our overall well-being, influencing how we think, feel, and act in our daily lives. <br>

            Understanding Mental Health
        </h2>
        <p>
            Mental health is a continuum that ranges from flourishing to struggling. Just as physical health exists on a spectrum, so does mental health. <br>
            It is important to realize that experiencing mental health challenges is a common part of the human experience and does not define a person's worth. <br>
            Mental health disorders, such as anxiety and depression, can be caused by a <em> combination of genetic, environmental, and psychological factors.</em> 
            However, everyone can take steps to promote their mental well-being.
